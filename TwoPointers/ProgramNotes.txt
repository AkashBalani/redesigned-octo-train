Program Notes

We initialize two pointers and move them from opposite ends. The first pointer starts moving toward the middle from the very first element of our string, wwhile the second pointer starts moving towards the middle from the very last element of our string. This allows us to compare these elements at every stingle instance to find a non-matching pair, and if they reach the middle of the string without encountering any non-matching pair, that means we indeed traverse a palindrome.
